# Blockchain Academia - Summer 2025

## 📚 About the Summer School

The Blockchain Academia Summer 2025 was hosted in Cluj-Napoca at the UTCN Hub. The program covered **philosophy, technology, and business** aspects of blockchain, and was conducted in a hybrid format: **synchronously onsite** and **asynchronously "offsite"**.

Students learned fundamental concepts about the Ethereum Blockchain, including:
- 🛠️ **Coding** smart contracts
- 🚀 **Deploying** decentralized applications
- 💰 **DeFi** (Decentralized Finance) principles
- 📖 **Use cases** and real-world applications

The final days of the program were dedicated to a **public goods hackathon**, where participants worked to find innovative blockchain solutions for Romania.
